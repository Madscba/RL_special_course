Reinforcement Learning Codebase Structure
------
Here's an overview of the folders and the corresponding classes/modules:

'agents/'
-
This folder contains classes representing different RL agents. Each agent should be in a separate file. The following files can be included:

base_agent.py: An abstract base class for RL agents with common functionality.
dqn_agent.py: A class implementing the Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent.
policy_gradient_agent.py: A class implementing a policy gradient-based agent.
Other agent implementations.


'environments/'
-
This folder holds classes representing RL environments. Each environment should be in a separate file. The following files can be included:

base_environment.py: An abstract base class for RL environments with common functionality.
gridworld_environment.py: A class implementing a gridworld environment.
gym_environment.py: A class wrapping an OpenAI Gym environment.
Other environment implementations.

'models/'
-
This folder contains classes representing models or neural networks used by the RL agents. Each model should be in a separate file. The following files can be included:

base_model.py: An abstract base class for models with common functionality.
neural_network_model.py: A class implementing a neural network model for function approximation.
Other model implementations.

'utils/'
-
This folder contains utility modules that can be used by the RL agents, environments, or models. The following files can be included:

replay_buffer.py: A class implementing a replay buffer for experience replay.
logger.py: A module for logging and monitoring training progress.
Other utility modules.

'shell_scripts/': This folder provides scripts for running the methods with different configurations.


main.py
-
To use this codebase structure, you can create your RL agent by subclassing the appropriate base agent class, implement the necessary methods, and import any required classes or modules from the corresponding folders.

For example, if you're implementing a DQN agent, you can import the DQNAgent class from agents/dqn_agent.py and inherit from the BaseAgent class defined in agents/base_agent.py. Similarly, you can import other classes or modules as needed.

from agents.dqn_agent import DQNAgent
from environments.gridworld_environment import GridWorldEnvironment
from models.neural_network_model import NeuralNetworkModel

# Instantiate the DQN agent
agent = DQNAgent()

# Instantiate the GridWorld environment
env = GridWorldEnvironment()

# Instantiate the neural network model
model = NeuralNetworkModel()

# Start the training or evaluation process
# ...


'results'
-
This folder contains results achieved with the different methods.

CPU is faster for training (at least with my on my PC)
